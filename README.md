Exam_2 school 42 

Date : 23 july 2021

Result : 100%

The exam is made of 2 questions and you have 2 hours to do it : 
 #1 inter or union
 #2 get_next_line or printf

This is the easiest way I found to do them. It took me about 50 min.

I had to do union and printf so I never tested the others but i'm pretty sure they would work.

Edit : get_next_line and printf subjects have been updated to a new version so theses one are not up to date.
